<h2>Task 1</h2>
Originally, we chose to show the data distribution between each of the three classes using Histograms.

Later we realized that having three separate histograms was a poor visualization of the data imbalance so we created a bar graph with each class along with their corresponding frequencies. Since there was a data imbalance with most of the data maintaining a <b>fetal_health</b> classification of <b>1</b>, we use a Stratified Train-Test Split which splits the data to preserve the same proportions of data in each class.

<h2>Task 2</h2>
To find the 10 most reflective features of fetal health, we calculated the Pearon's Correlation Coefficient of each feature using the <b>scipy.stats.pearsonr</b> function. Once that was calculated, we sorted their absolute values in ascending order and extracted the last 10 from the list. Since <b>scipy.stats.pearsonr</b> returns both the Correlation Coefficient and a pvalue, we compared the pvalue against <b>0.1</b> and <b>0.05</b> to prove that the correlation is statistically significant based on 90% and 95% confidence intervals.<br><br>

<h2>Task 3</h2>
For our two models we chose a decision tree and a gaussian naive bayes. We selected these two classifier models as they both highly accurate with <b>multiclass problems</b> and typically produce comparable results, with the primary difference between them being that GNB assumes classes are independent of each other and the decision tree does not. We used the recommended 70/30 Train-Test Split. For consistencyâ€™s sake, we also used the same random state, so that the results of our models would be reproducible and comparable. Below is the visualization of our decision tree model.

<h2>Task 4</h2>
We used the <b>heatmap</b> function from the <b>seaborn module</b> to create a 3x3 visualization of our confusion matrix. Each matrix, seen below, highlights the data imbalance of the dataset, as you can see the majority of predicted values are being correctly classified as <b>Normal</b>. Though the data could have been binarized into a 2x2 matrix, the 3x3 matrix still provides all relevant information, specifically the calculations for true/false positive/negative values for each class. Two of the most relevant of these calculations, TPR and FNR, are as follows.<br><br>

<b>True Positive Ratios:</b><br>
Decision Tree = 567/638 = 0.88871 ~= <b>89%</b><br>
GNB = 511/638 = 0.80094 ~= <b>80%</b><br><br>

<b>False Negative Ratios:</b><br>
Decision Tree = 63/638 = 0.09874 ~= <b>10%</b><br>
GNB = 126/638 = 0.19749 ~= <b>20%</b><br><br>

<h2>Task 6</h2>
For K-Means clustering, we used the <b>KMeans</b> function from <b>sklearn.cluster</b>. This was used to create the different clusters once the data was plotted. We decided to plot <b>baseline value</b> and <b>fetal_movement</b> on a scatterplot. As shown through the figures, the fetuses had a higher movement when their baseline values (in beats per minute) were closer to 120. If their heart rate fell lower or higher than that, that signaled an implication and therefore they had less movements.
